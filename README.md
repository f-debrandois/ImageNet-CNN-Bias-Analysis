# 📊 ImageNet-CNN-Bias-Analysis

This project investigates the performance of state-of-the-art CNN models, LeNet and ResNet, on a subset of the ImageNet dataset and explores the impact of dataset bias on model predictions.

## 📖 Description

In this project, part of the ModIA course, we focus on training and evaluating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as LeNet and ResNet on ImageNet data. The study also delves into how biases introduced in the dataset can affect the predictions of these models. Key areas of exploration include:
- 🔍 **Model Training and Evaluation**: Comparing the performance of LeNet and ResNet architectures.
- 🔎 **Bias Analysis**: Understanding and quantifying the impact of biased datasets on model predictions using the Disparate Impact (DI) metric.

This project aims to provide insights into both the capabilities of modern CNN architectures and the challenges posed by dataset biases in machine learning.
